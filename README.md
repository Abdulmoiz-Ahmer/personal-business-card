# Interactive 3D Business Card

A modern, interactive business card built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Framer Motion. Features a 3D hover effect, smooth animations, and social media links.

## Features

- 3D card rotation effect
- Animated avatar
- Social media links with hover effects
- Responsive design
- Modern glassmorphism UI

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- React Icons

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Customize

To customize the card with your information, edit the `personalInfo` object in `src/pages/index.tsx`.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
